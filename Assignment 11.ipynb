    "Using logging messages is generally better than using print() for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Configurability: The logging module allows you to configure logging behavior, including setting log levels, specifying log \n",
    "destinations (e.g., files, consoles, network services), and defining log message formatting. This configurability provides more \n",
    "control over how and where log messages are displayed or stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Log Levels: Logging supports different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), allowing you to categorize \n",
    "messages by their severity. With print(), you have to manually implement your own message filtering based on severity, while \n",
    "logging provides built-in support for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Centralized Logging: Logging messages are typically centralized, making it easier to manage and analyze logs in one place. \n",
    "With print(), messages are scattered throughout the code, making it harder to monitor and troubleshoot issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Output Redirection: With logging, you can easily redirect log messages to various outputs (e.g., files, the console, remote\n",
    "servers) and control where the logs are stored. This is more challenging with print().\n",
